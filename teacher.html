        Teaching Philosophy

      <p class="text-center">
        In my approach to teaching Computer Science, I am deeply guided by Benjamin Bloom’s famous 2 Sigma Problem (Bloom, 1984), 
which showed that students who receive one-on-one tutoring perform two standard deviations better than those in a conventional classroom. 
This finding highlights the immense potential of personalized learning — but also the challenge: 
how can we replicate the transformative power of tutoring in a traditional classroom with 20 or more students?

  “Whether you want to uncover the secrets of the universe, or you just want to pursue a career in the 21st century, basic computer programming is an essential skill to learn.” — Stephen Hawking

<p>
  A key pillar of my practice is the flipped classroom model (Bergmann & Sams, 2012), where students engage with core content — 
  videos, readings, interactive materials — before class, freeing up classroom time for hands-on activities, problem-solving, and 
  deeper discussions. This approach leverages repetition and familiarity: when students encounter the material multiple times 
  (first at home, then in class), their confidence and comprehension grow.
  </p>
  

<p>
My philosophy is centered on bridging this gap by striking a balance between the traditional classroom and the individualized attention of tutoring. 
I believe the modern digital era has gifted us tools — from adaptive learning platforms to collaborative coding environments — 
that can help close this gap. When used effectively, these tools allow us to tailor instruction, provide immediate feedback, and 
meet students where they are, creating a learning experience that approaches the effectiveness of one-on-one tutoring.
</p>


<p>
In my experience teaching Computer Science, I have seen how this combination improves both engagement and outcomes. 
Students come to class prepared with questions, ready to apply concepts in coding exercises, collaborative projects, or algorithm challenges. 
The classroom shifts from a place of passive listening to an active lab of experimentation and exploration. Importantly, digital 
tools like Google Classroom, Scratch, or Python notebooks allow me to track progress, provide targeted feedback, and adapt 
lessons to individual needs — moving closer to Bloom’s vision of “tutoring at scale.”

<p>
  As I guide students toward meaningful learning, I also remind them of an important insight, Coding is not programming. Coding is the easiest part. It’s not just about writing lines of code, but about developing problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and creativity. My goal is to help students understand the bigger picture behind the code — how to approach challenges thoughtfully and design solutions that matter.
  Ultimately, my goal is to foster not just technical proficiency but independent, resilient learners who are empowered 
to explore, make mistakes, and grow — supported by a teaching framework that blends the best of human connection and technological innovation.
