        A little bit about myself
      </h2><br><br>
      <p class="text-center">
        I wrote my first computer program in Grade 8. It was a calculator in Visual Basic that could solve 
        quadratic, cubic, and systems of linear equations. 
        I didn’t know the term “polynomial root solver” back then, 
        but I remember the thrill of turning math into something interactive. 
        
        That early moment lit a spark in me, not just for programming, but for the joy of creating something useful from scratch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since then, that curiosity has grown into a career that’s spanned engineering, research, and teaching. 
        I’ve worked on things from building image processing tools and predictive algorithms, 
        to developing multi-agent AI systems.
      </p>

      <p><span class="highlight">But my favorite part of all this? Teaching.</span>, </p>

      <p>
        I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Engineering from the University of Peradeniya, and later pursued my Master’s degree in Technology at the University of Oulu, Finland  both of which strengthened my technical foundation and problem-solving skills.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Along the way, I co-founded a Non-Profit STEM School called Project Nenathambara aimed at teaching Computer Science to children, drawing inspiration from some of the world’s leading education curricula — including the <span class="highlight">Edexcel curriculum</span> (UK), Singapore’s <span class="highlight">National Curriculum Framework</span>, Finland’s <span class="highlight">National Core Curriculum</span>, and the <span class="highlight">Common Core State Standards</span> (USA). Our goal was to make coding and computational thinking accessible, engaging, and relevant for young learners.
      </p>
     

      
      <p>
        I’ve been fortunate to work with children for over five years, teaching a wide range of Computer Science topics — from basic coding and algorithms to robotics and data science. Beyond teaching, I’ve gained hands-on experience in curriculum design, lesson planning, classroom delivery, assessment, and integrating digital tools to enhance learning. Whether it’s preparing students for exams, guiding them through hands-on projects, or helping them debug their first program, I’m passionate about making Computer Science both approachable and empowering.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        In addition to my teaching, engineering, and research work, I’ve also had the opportunity to collaborate with the Department of Education in Sri Lanka — the state body responsible for national schools — to help bridge the gap between Sri Lanka’s ICT curriculum and global education standards like the <span class="highlight">Edexcel curriculum</span>. I’ve contributed by advising on curriculum enhancements and aligning teaching practices with international benchmarks.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I’ve also delivered structured professional development courses for ICT teachers across Sri Lanka, focusing on modern teaching methodologies and the practical use of <span class="highlight">AI-powered tools in the classroom</span>. It’s been incredibly rewarding to empower teachers with both the knowledge and confidence to integrate technology into their lessons.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I believe deeply in the pedagogical power of <span class="highlight">flipped learning</span>, where students engage with content before class and apply their knowledge actively during lessons. More importantly, I see Computer Science as more than just learning to code — it’s a gateway to developing <span class="highlight">critical thinking</span>, <span class="highlight">problem-solving skills</span>, and a mindset of lifelong learning. And that’s the journey I aim to inspire in every student I teach.
